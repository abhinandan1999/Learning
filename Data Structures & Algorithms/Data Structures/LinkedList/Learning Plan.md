# âœ… Linked List Mastery Checklist

---

## 1. Fundamentals (Python)
- [ ] Understand array vs linked list trade-offs in Python
- [ ] Implement Singly Linked List using Python classes

---

## 2. Basic Operations

### ðŸ”¹ Insertion
- [ ] Insert at beginning - _Done_
- [ ] Insert at end - _Done_
- [ ] Insert before a element - _Done_
- [ ] Insert after a element - _Done_
- [ ] Insert at a specific Position - _Done_

### ðŸ”¹ Deletion
- [ ] Delete from beginning - _Done_
- [ ] Delete from end - _Done_
- [ ] Delete by value - _Done_
- [ ] Delete by position - _Done_

### ðŸ”¹ Traversal & Search
- [ ] Traverse iteratively - _Done_
- [ ] Traverse recursively - _Done_
- [ ] Search for a value

### ðŸ”¹ Other Basics
- [ ] Get length (iterative) - _Done_
- [ ] Get length (recursive)
- [ ] Reverse the list (iterative)
- [ ] Reverse the list (recursive)

---

## 3. Intermediate Techniques

- [ ] Reverse a sublist between positions `m` and `n`
- [ ] Find middle node using slow and fast pointers
- [ ] Detect cycle using Floydâ€™s algorithm
- [ ] Remove a cycle
- [ ] Find the start node of a cycle
- [ ] Merge two sorted linked lists
- [ ] Remove duplicates from sorted list
- [ ] Remove duplicates from unsorted list (use set or hashmap)
- [ ] Find `k`-th node from the end (two-pointer approach)
- [ ] Check if a linked list is a palindrome (stack or reverse second half)
- [ ] Delete a node without head pointer (not Pythonic but for practice)
- [ ] Clone a linked list with random pointers (using dictionary mapping)
- [ ] Find the intersection node of two linked lists
- [ ] Partition list around a value `x`

---

## 4. Advanced Problems

- [ ] Merge K sorted linked lists (use `heapq`)
- [ ] Flatten a multilevel doubly linked list
- [ ] Implement LRU Cache using `OrderedDict` or Doubly Linked List + Dict
- [ ] Reverse nodes in k-group
- [ ] Rotate list to the right by k places
- [ ] Reorder list: L0 â†’ Ln â†’ L1 â†’ Ln-1 â†’ ...
- [ ] Implement Skip List (Optional for system-level design)
- [ ] Implement XOR linked list using `ctypes` (advanced Python)
- [ ] Remove nodes with greater value on right
- [ ] Sort linked list (use Merge Sort in Python)

---

## 5. Design & Performance

- [ ] Analyze time and space complexity for all operations
- [ ] Write unit tests using `unittest` or `pytest`

---

## 6. Practice & Real-world Readiness

- [ ] Apply linked list in:
  - [ ] LRU Cache implementation
  - [ ] Browser history design
  - [ ] Undo/redo stack in editor

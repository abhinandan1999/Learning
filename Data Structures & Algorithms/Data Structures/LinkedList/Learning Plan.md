# ✅ Linked List Mastery Checklist

---

## 1. Fundamentals (Python)
- [ ] Understand array vs linked list trade-offs in Python
- [ ] Implement Singly Linked List using Python classes

---

## 2. Basic Operations

### 🔹 Insertion
- [ ] Insert at beginning - _Done_
- [ ] Insert at end - _Done_
- [ ] Insert before a element - _Done_
- [ ] Insert after a element - _Done_
- [ ] Insert at a specific Position - _Done_

### 🔹 Deletion
- [ ] Delete from beginning - _Done_
- [ ] Delete from end - _Done_
- [ ] Delete by value - _Done_
- [ ] Delete by position - _Done_

### 🔹 Traversal & Search
- [ ] Traverse iteratively - _Done_
- [ ] Traverse recursively - _Done_
- [ ] Search for a value - _Done_

### 🔹 Other Basics
- [ ] Get length (iterative) - _Done_
- [ ] Get length (recursive) - _Done_
- [ ] Reverse the list (iterative) - _Done_
- [ ] Reverse the list (recursive) - _Done_

## 3. Intermediate Techniques

- [ ] Reverse a sublist between positions `m` and `n` - _Done_
- [ ] Find middle node using slow and fast pointers - _Done_
- [ ] Detect cycle using Floyd’s algorithm - _Done_
- [ ] Remove a cycle - _Done_
- [ ] Find the start node of a cycle - _Done_
- [ ] Merge two sorted linked lists - _Done_
- [ ] Remove duplicates from sorted list - _Done_
- [ ] Remove duplicates from unsorted list (use set or hashmap) - _Done_
- [ ] Find `k`-th node from the end (two-pointer approach) - _Done_
- [ ] Check if a linked list is a palindrome (stack or reverse second half) - _Done_
- [ ] Delete a node without head pointer (not Pythonic but for practice)
- [ ] Clone a linked list with random pointers (using dictionary mapping)
- [ ] Find the intersection node of two linked lists - _Done_
- [ ] Partition list around a value `x`

---

## 4. Advanced Problems

- [ ] Merge K sorted linked lists (use `heapq`)
- [ ] Flatten a multilevel doubly linked list
- [ ] Implement LRU Cache using `OrderedDict` or Doubly Linked List + Dict
- [ ] Reverse nodes in k-group
- [ ] Rotate list to the right by k places
- [ ] Reorder list: L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln-1 → ...
- [ ] Implement Skip List (Optional for system-level design)
- [ ] Implement XOR linked list using `ctypes` (advanced Python)
- [ ] Remove nodes with greater value on right
- [ ] Sort linked list (use Merge Sort in Python)

---

## 5. Design & Performance

- [ ] Analyze time and space complexity for all operations
- [ ] Write unit tests using `unittest` or `pytest`

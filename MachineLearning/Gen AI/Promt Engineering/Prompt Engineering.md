### Promt Engineering
Prompt engineering is the process of designing high-quality prompts that guide LLMs to produce accurate outputs.
In the context of natural language processing and LLMs, a prompt is an input provided to the model to generate a response or prediction.

These prompts can be used to achieve various kinds of understanding and generation tasks such as text summarization, information extraction, question and answering, text classification, language or code translation, code generation, and code documentation or reasoning.

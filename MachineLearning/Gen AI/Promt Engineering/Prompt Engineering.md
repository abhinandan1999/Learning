### Promt Engineering
Prompt engineering is the process of designing high-quality prompts that guide LLMs to produce accurate outputs.
In the context of natural language processing and LLMs, a prompt is an input provided to the model to generate a response or prediction.

These prompts can be used to achieve various kinds of understanding and generation tasks such as text summarization, information extraction, question and answering, text classification, language or code translation, code generation, and code documentation or reasoning.

As a general rule of thumb, you should use at least three to five examples for few-shot prompting. However, you may need to use more examples for more complex tasks, or you may need to use fewer due to the input length limitation of your model. 2. When you choose examples for your prompt, use examples that are relevant to the task you want to perform. The examples should be diverse, of high quality, and well written. One small mistake can confuse the model and will result in undesired output. 3. If you are trying to generate output that is robust to a variety of inputs, then it is important to include edge cases in your examples. Edge cases are inputs that are unusual or unexpected, but that the model should still be able to handle." | "1. Improves task understanding and response consistency. 2.

A great open source content management system. I have used it in the past too. It comes with lots of great user plugins. And it's pretty easy to set up. I did notice a bug in the contact form, which happens when you select the name field. See the attached screenshot of me entering text in the name field. Notice the JavaScript alert box that I inv0k3d. But for the rest it's a great website. I enjoy reading it. Feel free to leave the bug in the website, because it gives me more interesting things to read. Cheers, Harry the Hacker. \`\`\` Classify the above email as IMPORTANT or NOT IMPORTANT.

ReAct prompting works by combining reasoning and acting into a thought-action loop. The LLM first reasons about the problem and generates a plan of action. It then performs the actions in the plan and observes the results. The LLM then uses the observations to update its reasoning and generate a new plan of action. This process continues until the LLM reaches a solution to the problem."                                                                                                                                                        | "1.

(3) <finish>answer</finish>, which returns the answer and finishes the task.

Action 2 <lookup>named after</lookup> Observation 2 Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, whose middle name was Milhous. Thought 3 Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, so the answer is Richard Nixon.

Thought 1 I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the area. Action 1 <search>Colorado orogeny</search> Observation 1 The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in Colorado and surrounding areas. Thought 2 It does not mention the eastern sector. So I need to look up eastern sector. Action 2 <lookup>eastern sector</lookup> Observation 2 The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called the Central Plains orogeny. Thought 3 The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I need to search High Plains and find its elevation range. Action 3 <search>High Plains</search> Observation 3 High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions Thought 4 I need to instead search High Plains (United States). Action 4 <search>High Plains (United States)</search> Observation 4 The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. From east to west, the High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130m). Thought 5 High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer is 1,800 to 7,000 ft. Action 5 <finish>1,800 to 7,000 ft</finish>" |
